If you're interested in the project, what we need most is feedback on our ideas
and suggestions for what IDL related problems to solve. What do you think is
lacking in the current generation of IDLs? What aspects of system or API design
do you wish you could express? These are the sorts of questions we're asking
ourselves and would appreciate your thoughts.

For now, use https://github.com/microglot/mglotc/discussions to pitch ideas or
ask questions. We'll put an update here and on Github when we have other ways to
engage.
